Once upon a time there was a girl named Julie. Julie was a grown up person with a job and a house when she woke up one morning and decided that life no longer suited her. So she quit her job, took out a student loan and drove from Denver to Boulder where she became one of the 5th Class (C5) at BDW. From August to December, every Wednesday afternoon was set aside for her to learn the most bizarre foreign language she'd ever come across - programming with Ruby. 

This repo is the product of those dozen or so Wednesday afternoons. I've learned a crap-ton about language, syntax, classes, initializing and objects but the most important lesson was that I can understand this. I might not ever write a program that changes the world, but understanding and reading that program can get me pretty damn far. 

So here's a list of what I did! Nothing too exciting, but it made my dad pretty proud. 


1. my_goals.rb
	Get comfortable with Ruby and GitHub. Write a simple program that prints out your goals for BDW, create a repo and push to GitHub. 

2. kickstarter.rb
	Write a program that calculates the average amount of revenue kickstarter makes a day based on all project stats.

3. tables.rb
	Write a program using variables that will tell us how many square feet of stain it would take to cover all the tables in this lab twice in a human readable format (a string).

4. time_left.rb
	Write a program using variables that will tell us how many months, days, hours, minutes and seconds are left in the year 2012 for humans and dogs in a human readable format.
	
5. editing_method.rb
	Create a program with methods that represents a physical object in the real world you use everyday. Pick something that has a lot of options and actions. Be sure to use methods that return Booleans, Strings, Fixnums and Floats. Make sure your methods follow the single responsibility principle. 

6. editing_method_array.rb & editing_method_array_hashes.rb
	Re-factor last weekâ€™s assignment to use Arrays and Hashes.

7. sodamachine.rb
	Build a program that models a soda machine. Accept user input to add or dispense sodas, and display the current stock levels of various sodas in the machine.

8. blackjack.rb
	Create a program to play blackjack! This one is a work in progress. I am determined to get it working, to be able to place bets
